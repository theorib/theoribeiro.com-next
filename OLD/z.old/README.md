# React + Vite

This is a personalised version of Vite's React Javascript template.
I've cleaned up the file structure so only the essential files are loaded.

This installation adds portfinder so the project always finds a new available port to run and it also opens the project in the browser as soon as it's run.

## This is Vite's original documentation:

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
